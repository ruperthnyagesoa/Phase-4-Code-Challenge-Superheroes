## Description

 <p>This project for Implementation of a 'mini' Rails application that implements associations of an an API for tracking heroes and their superpowers</p>

## Features

As a user of the application,you will be able to :

1. Create a Rails API backend.
2. Have at least three resources (three DB tables).


 ###  Requirements

 For this project, you must:

- Use Active Record to interact with a database.
- Have at least two models with a one-to-many relationship.
- At a minimum, set up the following API routes in Sinatra:
  - create and read actions for both models
  - full CRUD capability for one of the models
- Build a separate React frontend application that interacts with the API to
  perform CRUD actions.
- Use good OO design patterns. You should have separate classes for each of your
  models, and create instance and class methods as necessary.
